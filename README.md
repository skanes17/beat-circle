# Beat Circle

> Select a tempo and hit play to see and hear beats. The beats can be customized, and a circle is used to help visualize the rhythm.

## General Info

- I wanted to build a first project that was cool and useful, but which would also challenge me to learn many new skills. I used my music background as a starting point to create an app that helps people to visualize rhythm in novel way. Building the app forced me to quickly learn CSS and JavaScript in order to make the app dynamic and interesting.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)

## Features

- Select a tempo and hit play to see and hear the beats
- Customize the number and nature of each beat
- Search for a song to get its BPM
