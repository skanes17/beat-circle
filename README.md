# Beat Circle
> This app takes a tempo in beats per minute (BPM) and plays a beat, along with a neat little circle animation that repeats at the start of every bar.

## General Information
- With this project I created a metronome that does more than simply play a set number of beats at a given tempo. I wanted to emphasize the cyclical nature of rhythm by mashing together the ideas of a metronome and a clock, where the beat could be seen traveling around a circle.
- 
- This circular metronome is an improvement on the traditional metronome, as the visuals make it easy to see when the rhythm will repeat itself, especially for rhythms that have an unusual number of beats in a bar, like 7 beats or 13 beats!
- I chose this project because it seemed like it would force me to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all at once. From the first few moments of working on it I would have to determine how to make something happen based on a given number of beats from the user, which immediately required JavaScript. From there, CSS would be required for styling all the visual elements like the volumn columns and the "beat circle" itself. I also knew that I wanted to incorporate an API into the project, which I eventually did in the form of a search for BPMs to any song.
- I expected that this project would be exciting to work on because there would be so many moving parts (literally), and that I would constantly be problem-solving. I was not disappointed. I learned so much!

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ / _complete_ / _no longer being worked on_. If you are no longer working on it, provide reasons why.


## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- Improve performance on mobile devices - the program has some lag at higher tempos
- Replace the GetSongBPM API with the Spotify API
- Allow users to select from a library of beat sounds
- more?

To do:
- Replace volumn columns with vertical volume sliders
- more?
